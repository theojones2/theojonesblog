Unfortunately, Donald Trump won the election and it looks like he will become the next President of the United States. In this post I will elaborate on some of my thoughts about this.

<strong>What Will Happen to Government Policy?</strong>

I'm very worried about what Trump will do to international relations. The president has a lot of unilateral authority in that region. At least with domestic policy, there are a lot of breaks on presidential authority. There is Congress (which, even though GOP controlled will be able to filter out the worst Trump ideas). There is the Supreme Court. There are independent executive regulatory agencies. There are state governments. In short to get anything done in the domestic policy sphere you need to cut a deal with others, and get some degree of broad based support. The rich guy who has never been told no probably won't be a happy camper when he finds this out. And if anything there will be a silver lining here in terms of a renewed push from the left towards a minimalistic interpretation of executive branch power.

International relations are different. The president has enough control over the military to for all intensive purposes start a war on his own (even if Congress is needed to formally declare it). And I don't trust him to use this power in a restrained and well thought out way. To me Trump seems very rash and impulsive, and is very bad at handling offence. Not traits you want in the chief diplomat of the country. <a href="http://www.expressnews.com/news/news_columnists/brian_chasnoff/article/Trump-I-love-war-6630963.php">And he has a very militaristic style</a>, which runs the severe risk of getting America into pointless wars.

And Trump can also do a lot of unilateral damage on trade and immigration. He could increase substantially the number of deportations that happen, he could cancel the Obama administration executive actions on immigration, he could <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2016-09-19/trump-could-legally-withdraw-u-s-from-nafta-wto-report">pull the U.S out of the WTO and NAFTA</a>. And Congress would have very little chance to stop him, even if it wanted to. And this is very dangerous as immigration and trade are some of the best ways we have to help the global poor. The world needs to become more economically and culturally integrated, but Trump wants to move the world away from global unity and towards nationalism and xenophobia.

But Trump's ideas on domestic are also very bad, only buffered by their incoherence on many points. He will run the long-run deficit to record levels. He wants to repeal the ACA, which has expanded health care availability to millions, while his ideas for a "replacement"  are insufficient at best and incoherent at worst. His presence in the White House will put the brakes on climate change action long enough to make meeting the Paris targets effectively impossible. His choice for Vice President, Mike Pence, has a terrible record on LGBT rights.

Trump will probably get to pick at least two SCOTUS justices in his term. Scalia's post remains unfilled, and I suspect that there is a very good chance that at least one other justice will retire or die (Ginsburg is probably my guess for the next vacancy). Personally, I would like more centrist judges of the Kennedy or Roberts mold. However, I am worried that he will pick a very partizan court, and this will endanger both the quality of its rulings and its trust and credibility with the public at large, and may have very widespread implications for civil liberties, civil rights, and other important issues.

<strong>What does it mean for predicting future elections?</strong>

Nate Silver's projections for the election held up fairly well, as he was one of the few major predictors of elections to predict a close election. So, this is a major feather in his cap on this issue.And a major egg in the face of the people who predicted a blowout in Clinton's favor.

There has been a bit of a tension in the political science world between models that have partizan affiliation as definitive in elections, and models that show the candidate as definitive. This election points in the favor of the party-centric models. Trump on many grounds was about the worse candidate imaginable. But he did well. He kept the usual GOP base. This shows that voters are mostly deciding their vote on the basis of party affiliation, and party loyalty.

And there has been a strong <a href="http://www.reconsidermedia.com/something-to-consider/the-parties-who-cried-wolf">party that cried wolf dynamic here</a>. Hyperbolic and extreme attacks on political opponents, have loosened the credibility of those attacks even when they really do matter. Voters respond to what high placed officials and prominent leaders say. And those leaders have in the past damaged their credibility. Also, The wolf cry dynamic has, by conflating legitimate policy disagreement with being evil, damaged the weight people give to <em><strong>actual</strong></em>  severe defects in policy and personality.

<strong>Racism and Bigotry</strong>

There is, of course, a large role for racism and xenophobia in this election. Racism that is tied to protectionism and ultra nationalism has been for a long time one of the few socially acceptable forms of racism to openly express. And Trump's campaign, as Mitt Romney has put it, has created a dose of "trickle down racism". Trump has made bigoted views even more within the mainstream.

Trump's racism and pandering to racists, has made it clear that racism still has a very nasty role in politics. Trump's hot mic video and the response to it show how the worse forms of sexism still have a strong presence.

This must be acknowledged. And it must be fought very aggressively.

But the left has really screwed up with handling this. A large part of the left was under the impression that it could deal with racism by asserting a strong overton window, and punishing any malefactor that dared to cross it. This 1) caused blowback (cf. political correctness) and 2) didn't actually fix the issue. Voters minds need to be changed or their (even if extremely wrong and dangerous) will leak into politics. You need discourse and persuasion, or things will go very bad. You can't just turtle in the corner.

<strong>Class</strong>

A <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTk7arvp3QAhUO6WMKHcYIA58QqQIIIigAMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fwonk%2Fwp%2F2016%2F11%2F09%2Fhow-trump-won-the-revenge-of-working-class-whites%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_KUX9h1lGH-4kcqATj9u9La5rxg">lot of commentators</a> have noted the strong working class support that Trump got.

On one hand there is a strong sense in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/elections/exit-poll-analysis.html?_r=0">this is both somewhat true and way overstated</a>. The Democrats did do poorly relative to other elections in low income groups. However, there are some serious caveats here.

Trump's level of support was fairly uniform across income groups, and he did the worst in the two lowest income groups. And in the primary Trump's voters <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/">had a median income</a> of over $70,000, which is well above the average. It was more that Trump inherited the working class parts of the GOP base, he didn't bring those people into the GOP.

Populism really is the home turf of the white middle class, it was the core of both Trump's support in the GOP primary, and Bernie's support in the Democratic primary. And this election was in large part upper middle class white people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4p82vj/can_someone_explain_the_chicken_tenders_meme/">throwing their tendies</a> over the fact their demographic’s chokehold on the political system is at risk.

Although there is (as evinced by the Michigan results) a strong subset of the working class (particularly white and rural) that the Dems aren’t getting to. There has to be a lot of revaluation of how the Democratic party interacts with that demographic and a change in strategy. And perhaps a change in policy.

But a large part of the issue here is that middle class still has its chokehold and the Dems can’t afford to really make the valuable white middle class demographic worse off, even to help poor people, so tensions between demographics within poor people get stoked, and large scale redistribution towards people facing financial stress (particularly workers displaced by market changes due to automation and trade) is off the table.

And neither the populist xenophobic Bernie wing of Democratic party, nor the in the beltway Clinton wing has any good ideas here. Bernie's economic policies were mostly about giving free stuff to middle class voters (often with dubious economic justification, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanderss-health-care-plan-could-actually-hurt-the-poor/2016/02/28/f2e16496-dc08-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html">often at the expense of  the poor</a>). While the rest of the Democratic party hasn't even seriously tried to grapple this issue.

And then <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/11/the_respect_mot.html">there is the point that Bryan Caplan</a> made back in the aftermath of the 2012 election "<i>People vote for whoever respects them more''</i>.  Where "respect" is less about the effects of substantive policies on the groups involved, and more about the soft interactions involved. It's about not being blatantly insulting to the groups involved. It's about giving the appearance of caring.  And the left has been quite bad about showing this type of respect, and really doesn't appreciate the extent to which class can be a very strong axis of oppression on par with race or such. Class is at best secondary issue for the left. And the left has a tendency to be very insulting towards the working class demographic, even when the insults are tangentially at best related to the serious issues at stake (I'm seeing a lot of Facebook posts about "rednecks") . The right has been quite good about this, and does the minimum amount of lip-service needed to show respect towards this demographic, even if the GOP's policies are lacking.

And considering what I am seeing on social media, this may not change. I’m worried that the left will get the inverse message from this election and double down the behaviour that resulted in this, such as the hostility towards rural working class people and tendency to ignore class in forming policies. And therefore add gas to this dumpster fire. I had an anti-Trump Facebook friend seriously discuss "political literacy tests" to filter out stupid voters, and I saw a few ironic suggestions of that nature. There is a torrent of posts about "rednecks", and of course, the condescending low-info voters voting against their self interest type posts. And much less pointed at trying to understand the issues that drive them to vote for Trump-type candidates.

<strong>Addendum</strong>

See my response to an <a href="https://theopjones.tumblr.com/post/153017816077/class-is-at-best-secondary-issue-for-the-left">ask on tumblr</a> I received in response to this post

The ask
<blockquote>"Class is at best secondary issue for the left." look, you don't understand us. This is exactly what some of us have been fighting against. We were screaming doom about this narrative. We predicted right-wing populism taking up our turf. We weren't heard.</blockquote>
My response

I want to clarify a bit here. I wasn’t really referring to your part of the left, of course class is your bread and butter. (I think you are referring to this post of mine on my mainblog )

I was referring to the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and the SJ/campus activist part of the left.

And I will readily concede that it is very troublesome that the mainstream/clinton part of the Democratic Party responded to the defeats of the 70s and 80s by largely abdicating economic policy and stopping any serious attempts at helping the poor.

There are many people who are suffering severely due to the effects of automation and globalization and even though both are beneficial in the broad scheme of things, little has been done to help those that are suffering and make those changes as universally beneficial as possible. And even those changes aside, there are lots of poor people who need assistance. And who aren’t getting it. Despite my support for Clinton, I have very major issues with her policies (or lack of policies) on those matters.

And the SJ element of the left has refused to acknowledge and internalize how strongly class can be an axis of oppression (perhaps because a lot of the academics and writers involved are quite privileged in that regard). It has a nasty tendency to try to fix oppression by beating up on the most disadvantaged of the privileged group (instead of fighting those with actual power or unearned privilege) , as can be seen in its interaction with rural working class whites, or with neurodiverse individuals, or in many other cases.

And this means that the right has won on economic issues by default with little contest from the left. And its pernicious attempts to roll back the economic safety net have taken the day. I’m not a libertarian or a conservative, and I do think that the victory of the right is very troublesome and will hurt a lot of people.

But here is where I think we disagree. I don’t really think that rest of the left has offered a good alternative.

The Bernie segment of the Democratic Party is still a different type of isolationist populist. Bernie’s economic policies are centered on helping the upper middle class, not the working class or the poor. Relative to the ACA the poor would net lose under Bernie’s health care proposals. Bernie’s plan included a large flat payroll tax increase at the federal level, and put expenses on the states that would be covered by sales taxes, and would give poor very little that the ACA hasn’t. His education plan feeds the bubble elements of the higher education system, and throws money at many people who are already quite well off.

And the more traditionally socialist harder core elements of the left, I believe are making roughly the inverse mistake of the mainstream Democrats. The mistakes the left made during the 70s did serve to show that on grounds of efficiency markets fundamentally work, and thus to some degree they have to be kept at the core of the economy. Fixing the nasty distributional impacts of markets, and fixing market failures are extremely important goals (again I’m not a libertarian). But markets should exist in some form.
