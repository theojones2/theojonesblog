With the Trump presidency there has been a lot of newfound talk about the matter of the role of compromise versus obstructionism. There has been more than a little bit of inconsistency from both sides of aisle on this subject matter.

In this post I will discuss some of the dynamics that I feel exist here.
<ol>
 	<li>Compromise should be defined in terms of mutual benefit, not the ideals of one of the parties</li>
 	<li>Something is only a compromise when both sides benefit as per their own interests and values</li>
 	<li>A lot of time you get policy proposals that are really false compromises, ie, where a policy proposal is made that is a slight concession relative to the best possible outcome of one side, but which is nowhere near mutually beneficial.</li>
 	<li>I would define obstruction as one side pushing outcomes that are mutually harmful as an attempt to damage the other side</li>
 	<li>An additional possibility is an impasse where politicians involved have sufficiently different opinions that a compromise is not anywhere near possible, but nether side can really be blamed for it.</li>
 	<li>Politicians of both parties like to blame each other for the problems of the country, and like to claim that they are uniquely willing to come to the negotiating table.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Defining Compromise</strong>

The only really impartial way to look at what compromise in politics should be is by analyzing the status quo and mutual benefit from a policy. Mutual benefit, relative to the current system is at the core of compromise. This often means that one side may have to give up something, so, that the whole bit of legislation is beneficial for everyone involved. Indeed, the core of compromise is making concessions that turn a policy that may be beneficial to <em>some </em>into a policy that is beneficial to as close to everyone as possible.

The concept from economics of the difference between a Kaldor-Hicks efficient outcome and a Pareto efficient outcome is perhaps somewhat useful here. A Pareto efficient outcome is one that benefits everyone involved.  A Kaldor-Hicks outcome is a potential Pareto efficient outcome. Ie. one that <em>could</em> benefit  everyone involved -- if an ideal redistribution happened after the policy change. Imagine a town with a factory that emits a lot of smoke and pollution. The people of the town would mostly be cheerful to get rid of it. The workers at the factory, however, like their jobs. The cost of the pollution is so high that it exceeds the value of the job loss that would come to the workers. Imagine the case of 1) a lawsuit that got an injunction that forced the factory to shut down without anything being done for the workers at the factory, and 2) a situation where the factory was shut down by a law that also paid for the workers' job training in a new field of employment and compensated them for the job loss. 2 is a Pareto efficient outcome  -- everyone gets rid of the pollution but the workers don't face disproportionate economic harm. 1 is the Kaldor-Hicks efficient outcome -- the workers are harmed, but their is enough benefit from the change to go around that the workers could theoretically be compensated (but were not).

Compromise in politics is trying to create more political outcomes that are like option 2, and fewer that are like option 1.

This type of compromise seeking is widely beneficial, helps to reduce hyperpartizanship, and makes the overall political system more functional. An emphasis on compromise helps to defuse some of vitriol of politics, by making sure that there will be relatively few losers from a policy change. It helps to defuse some of the tensions that come from the possibility that people will start to think that the political system is being used as a tribalist weapon by the members of one party versus the members of the other party.

I'm not saying that every policy decision should be shoehorned into an attempt to find a mutually beneficial compromise. There are, of course, a number of political issues that are zero sum in a way that means that one side will by nature be on the losing side.   However, it is something that should be done a lot more than has been done in the past, and I also believe that the decline of serious attempts to build compromise are a big part of why political tribalism has ascended. The goal of a lot of politicians is to destroy the other side, not to attempt to build community. Activists and politicians often develop the mindset that the interests and values of the other side have no value, and thus can be disregarded with malice.  Therefore, people -- often rightly so -- see an imminent personal threat in their political opponents. Building compromise is at the core of breaking this pattern.

<strong>Fake Compromise</strong>

What compromise isn't is an a concession <em>relative to your own views </em>that still leaves the other side a lot worse off. That's a fake compromise. And it happens a lot with highly controversial culture war type issues like abortion or gun control. And this can create a lot of nasty issues that potentially break political discourse.

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><b>The nibbling at the edge issue</b>. If there are two politically powerful groups at the extremes of an issue, you can get a situation where, due to the existence of moderates and institutional constraints, neither side can win outright, but one of the extremes can incrementally advance through small advances due to the ability to carve out groups of moderates and also due to the ability to paint the other side as unwilling to compromise. Eventually, the small victories will add up to something that starts to look at lot like total victory.</li>
 	<li><b>The shelling point issue</b>. On some issues, there is reason to believe that the government will consistently make sub-optimal issues. This can be dealt with by creating a strong taboo/institutional constraints against legislating on these issues, but, if those constraints are weakened then the floodgates will open.</li>
 	<li><b>The overton window shifting issue</b>. The proponents of $policy have values that, if applied consistently, would suggest a much broader change in policy. Due to status-quo bias they aren’t yet advocating this, but the range of policy discussion will gradually shift in that direction.</li>
</ul>
These types of dynamics happen a lot with both abortion and gun control. You have "reasonable" limits pushed as a "compromise", with the long-run possibility of a radically altered long-run political dynamic. And when politicians try to meet their goals in such a way, but have the gall not to admit it by calling it a compromise, it can cause a lot of damage. I'm not saying that politicians should refuse to entertain the thought of making policy in those areas. And indeed, with a lot of those culture war issues there isn't really room for a true compromise.  But they should realize and admit that a lot of people -- for quite possibly good reason are going to not be happy with those policies.

<strong>Obstruction</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141" src="https://theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mcclatchy_debt_ceiling.jpg" alt="mcclatchy_debt_ceiling" width="400" height="447" />

My working definition of political obstructionism is doing actions that make both sides involved worse off (or which make the political system as a whole less functional) in order to force a political concession that makes one side worse off.

I think the debt ceiling controversy was a good example of this. A system where the appropriations for spending were made, but the debt needed to fund that spending were not would of been wildly chaotic. And thus it would be very bad to use that as a negotiating ploy.

<strong>Impasse and blame</strong>

Its a feature of the American political system that Congress and the President are elected separately, and thus there is no reason to suspect that legislative and executive branches will be in alignment with each other. This means that it is more than possible that Congress and the President will have wildly different views about what good policy is (as evinced by the events of the last eight years). When they are at loggerheads about good policy then you get an impasse where noting can get done.

The government shutdown was quite different from the debt ceiling crisis in that it was more due to an impasse and difference in policy goals between the branches of government. The President wanted funding for the ACA and related measures, Congress didn't. And because both Congress and the President are needed to get policy passed, the system was at a gridlock. I don't think it is very useful to say that either side "caused" this impasse. Because it was the <em>mutual </em>disagreement in policy between <em>both</em> of the participants that caused it. But it does show how both sides will try their hardest to cast blame on each other.
