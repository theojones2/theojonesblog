In this post I will sketch out some of my thoughts on two questions.
<ul>
 	<li>What has caused the recent uptick in political polarization?</li>
 	<li>Why has the right polarized more quickly than the left?</li>
</ul>
One fact that has been made clear by the recent presidential election and its aftermath is that the country is very divided, and polarized, with extremism taking center stage in American politics. But it is also clear that, while a progression towards extremism has happened to some degree on the left, it has unfolded much more quickly on the right. The most extreme parts of the GOP as represented by Donald Trump have been able to, for all intensive purposes, take over the party.  In the Democratic Party, however, the establishment wing of the party has been able to hold its ground for the time being.

Why is the left less susceptible to the influence of political extremism?

It's not so much because of the lack of extreme voices, as those exist in legion, as discussed <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/children-revolution-14786.html">by this recent article</a>. It's more that for various reasons, the institutions of the political left have been much better at keeping its worst parts out of the mainstream.

Here is my model of this. I think a lot of the increase of extremism on all sides of American politics is due to the increasing ability for people to isolate themselves from serious engagement with other viewpoints. The Internet allows you to bubble yourself in media sources (often severely lacking in rigor) that reinforce your viewpoints. Cable television is also to do the same thing to a lesser degree. New media, unlike old media is therefore loaded with a tendency to be inherently ideological. In the old media landscape this was limited to some degree by the mere scale and cost of setting up a media outlet.   And then there is what <a href="http://www.thebigsort.com/home.php">author Bill Bishop called</a> the big sort, people are moving to communities and entering social groups where people are largely like minded on political issues, further eliminating their ability to engage with people who are not like them or do not share their views.

This has a number of nasty effects. The first is that it eliminates a lot of potential room for productive discourse. If you don't know any people who have a viewpoint it is hard to understand it. It is unlikely that you will interact with arguments against it. You will be trapped in a bubble. And this leads directly to the second major issue, what <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0189ILWJC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Nat Greene and Erik Fogg call the wedging effect</a>. It becomes a viable strategy for politicians  and media outlets to try to vilify their political opponents and to use some of the most incendiary political issues in the political system as a lever towards this.

You can portray the other side as a imminent threat to your most core values, and thus fuel the flames of political tensions. The fact that people are less likely than ever to actually interact with and understand viewpoints other than their own make this much easier. It's easier to think that an abstraction is evil than an actual  person that you know in real life. It's harder to see though strawmanning of ideas if you have never seen the real idea explained to you before. And this cycle rapidly becomes self reinforcing, in a dangerous runaway feedback loop.

Greene and Fogg also discuss another core part of the veer towards extremism. People with extreme viewpoints are much more likely to participate in politics (<a href="http://www.reconsidermedia.com/something-to-consider/is-the-tail-wagging-the-dog">as shown in the two graphs below</a>). This has two effects. One, it makes politicians and media outlets even more willing to cater to them. Two, it biases political decisions towards their worldview.

Here is where I form my hypothesis on why Democratic Party political institutions have been more resilient towards being taken over by extremists. Note that, while the effect shown in the second graph is still there for both liberals and conservatives, the extremism/political participation effect is noticeably weaker for liberals than for conservatives. This means that, even though extremism is growing, the new extremists, when liberal will not be as likely to try intensely to get their views put into policy. The most extreme Democratic voters, therefore cannot as easily take over their party's political institutions as their GOP equivalents.

I can speculate a bit on some of the reasons for this. I think it is likely that a lot of the same factors that can make someone have extreme left wing viewpoints can also make one disengage from the political system all together.
