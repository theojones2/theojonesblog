As you have probably heard already, President Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/trump-immigration-refugees-visa-policy/index.html">signed an executive order</a> [1. CNN article "What to know about Trump's visa and refugee restrictions" <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6ntB4hcni">http://www.webcitation.org/6ntB4hcni</a> <a href="http://archive.is/8sBQz">http://archive.is/8sBQz</a> ] restricting immigration, and prohibiting all travelers from a number of countries from entering the United States. This order and a number of Trump's other decisions on immigration and related issues are absolutely terrible. Despite the fact that I don't really know people who are directly affected by this, there is a level of sadness and anger at this decision that is difficult to get through on writing. This order directly will harm tens of thousands of people. Trump's other decisions on immigration and trade will increase this to millions of people who could face severe harm from Trump's decisions. His embrace of xenophobia, isolationism, and protectionism is by far the most destructive set of policy ideas that Trump has. The human cost of these policies is truly terrible and depressing in every way.

Last year, over 36,000 people were admitted as refugees from the areas covered by the Trump order.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44" src="https://theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-from-2017-01-29-16-07-49.png" alt="" width="785" height="420" />

Many of these individuals were fleeing the worse parts of the civil war in Syria (and its spill over into Iraq). Many of them were fleeing brutally oppressive governments. The effort to resettle refugees from temporary camps to permanent settlement should be accelerated, not discontinued.

The conditions in the <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/utterly-inhumane-canadian-nurse-describes-conditions-in-syrian-refugee-camp-1.2680412">temporary refugee camps that the refugees live in before resettlement are bleak,</a> [2. article title "'Utterly inhumane': Canadian nurse describes conditions in Syrian refugee camp" <a href="http://archive.is/vo95P">http://archive.is/vo95P</a>  <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6ntBRXY8r">http://www.webcitation.org/6ntBRXY8r</a> ] and drastically unsafe for long term habitation. The temporary tents and structures in these camps lack heating for the winter and proper cooling, <a href="http://unhcr.org.au/news/unhcr-study-shows-rapid-deterioration-in-living-conditions-of-syrian-refugees-in-jordan/">they lack effective sewage disposal infrastructure and lack many other essential infrastructure</a> [3. article title "UNHCR study shows rapid deterioration in living conditions of Syrian refugees in Jordan" <a href="http://archive.is/HCm9N">http://archive.is/HCm9N</a> <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6ntBawUBd">http://www.webcitation.org/6ntBawUBd</a> ] .  <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52893#.WI55w_ErLCI">Around 70 percent of the refugees living in camps</a> [4. article title "Conditions of Syrian refugees in Lebanon worsen considerably, UN report" <a href="http://archive.is/gkVA2">http://archive.is/gkVA2</a> <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6ntBjHr3n">http://www.webcitation.org/6ntBjHr3n</a> ] in neighboring countries in the middle east face extreme poverty and or food shortages.

It is clear that many of those who would of been allowed into America were it not for Trump's order will die as a result of this decision.

Take the widespread malnutrition and food insecurity in those camps. It should be fairly clear how that can affect mortality, and harm the long run health of those in the camps, but let me spell it out.  The <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573447188010174">academic literature in medicine is clear</a> [5. Behrman, Jere R., and Anil B. Deolalikar. "Health and nutrition." <i>Handbook of development economics</i> 1 (1988): 631-711.] that long run exposure to the type of food security that the UN has found in the refugee camps is greatly detrimental to the health of those affected. It increases the mortality of infectious diseases. It has widespread comorbidity with many non-infectious diseases.

Or take the spread of infectious diseases that will happen in the camps.

Or take the lack of availability of basic health services in the camps.

In short if those in the refugee camps are not resettled in a more permanent way, then the results will likely be tragic. It would be fair to estimate that the average person not taken in to America due to the refugee ban has had their lifespan reduced by 10 percent.

The national security and economic case is weak to nonexistent. It is extremely rare for terrorists or criminals to enter the country though the refugee process. Even from the most pessimistic estimates of that number, it is clear that many more people will suffer from not letting the refugees in than from any crimes they do commit. Let's say, that at the most extreme,  allowing refugees in at the current rate throughout Trump's term would cause one 9/11 level terrorist attack (something that I am nowhere near willing to concede as a fact, but I will entertain to make a point). Allowing the refugees in, when you look at both the lives saved and the improvements to quality of life would probably do the equivalent to saving 14,000 lives. Allowing the refugees in, even by the most extreme negative possibility would of been on the net positive by a substantial margin. And that doesn't even count the many other non-refugee migrants and travelers that have been excluded by Trump's order.

And there are many safeguards against letting dangerous people into the country. Despite Trump's assertions otherwise, we already have "extreme vetting". It takes years to go through the refugee process. There are background checks. There are interviews. It is quite unlikely that anyone who is dangerous will get through the process.

With the nationality security defence of this, I since a amoral treatment of the lives of foreigners as close to fully expendable. As far as I can tell Trump doesn't really consider the costs that his policies will have on anyone but his constituents. He doesn't care about the foreigners who will die as a result. He doesn't care about the non-americans who will be impoverished due to his policies. He is willing to throw away an almost unlimited number of lives to meet his domestic policy goals. He doesn't care about all the people who will be hurt and maimed.  It's a mindset that I have a very hard time understanding. And it's hard to believe that it comes from anywhere but racism and callousness and xenophobia.

And then there are the non refugee migrants who will be affected by the Trump order. Students. Parents. Children. People who are just looking for a better life. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/immigration-ban-stories/">CNN did a series of interviews</a> [6. "These are the faces of Trump's ban" <a href="http://archive.is/TTsHO">http://archive.is/TTsHO</a> <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6ntEjPY6t">http://www.webcitation.org/6ntEjPY6t</a> ] that show some of those stories, and I recommend reading that article)

And all of them will have their world upturned. For nothing but an act of pointless fear that turned into cruelty.
