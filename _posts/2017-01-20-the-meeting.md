<h3><em>This is an attempt of mine at a flash fiction. </em></h3>
<!--more-->

The first response to my presentation to the meeting of the planning board came almost immediately.
<blockquote>Look, we've lived here our whole lives, and this proposal of yours .... it ... it's to put it frankly it's garbage. No one here benefits except the people who own the hotels. It will change everything about the community and its environment .. but ... but for what? Some money? The people of this community like the ecosystem the way it is. They like the trees, the plants ... don't change it.</blockquote>
Back in 2105, mayor Marshall Small named me to lead the ecosystem board for Pioneer --- an orbital space colony. I manage the artificial ecosystem that the colony contains.

The station was finished in 2038, and the first residents helped build a network of orbital solar panels to provide energy to Earth. These solar panels soon became the top energy source on Earth, and many similar colonies have been constructed. Over 175 million people live in over 300 space colonies in Earth orbit.

These colonies have become dominant in humanity's industrial production, as a majority of industrial production has been relocated to them. Energy is trivial to produce in space --- there is no atmosphere blocking the sun. And the easy access to minerals and metals through asteroid mining has proved very beneficial.

Currently, Pioneer is one of the smaller ones at a population of around 100,000.

I'm a second generation resident of this place, as my parents moved here seeking opportunity in the mid 21st century.

But, I was appointed in a time of change.

The growth of demand for new energy production has waned over the past two decades as economic development has concluded throughout all of Earth. There are no longer any impoverished regions of the planet as there were in the 21st century. The most laggard countries in the planet have become at the same level as all the others.

This means that the boom in energy production is no more --- replaced by a slow trickle of an increase.

Unfortunately, my community has suffered economically after this change.

A small town of a space colony like mine cannot compete in regards to most other industries with the powerhouses that are the most populous colonies.

The answer --- at least according to mayor Small and myself -- is space tourism.

We want to become a hub for tourists looking for a vacation, and some relaxation. This has been  a booming market after the recent construction of a launch loop on Earth as made entering space barely more difficult or expensive than an airline flight.

This is where my proposal comes in. The previous generation of colonists -- mostly from the United Kingdom, which built Pioneer  -- wanted an artificial climate and ecosystem that was like home for them. However, most tourists don't want harsh "winters", or cold.

I want to transition the colony's climate and ecosystem to a much more mellow mediterranean climate. No harsh "winters", just temperate artificial "weather".
